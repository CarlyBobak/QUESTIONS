\title{Row-wise normalize a sparse matrix}
\usage{
normalize_rows(W, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{W}{A sparse matrix of class `dgCMatrix`, typically an adjacency or TOM matrix.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, prints the number of rows that were corrected (i.e., had a sum of zero).}
}
\value{
A row-normalized sparse matrix of the same dimensions and class.
}
\description{
This function normalizes each row of a sparse matrix so that the row sums to 1.
This is often required before diffusion or spillover modeling to create a row-stochastic matrix.
}
\details{
If any row has a sum of zero (i.e., disconnected node), the function replaces the diagonal entry
for that row with 1, effectively preserving its identity and avoiding division by zero.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
W_norm <- normalize_rows(W)
}
